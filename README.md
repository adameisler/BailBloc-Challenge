# Paying Bail with Blockchain Challenge Presented by [Bail Bloc](https://bailbloc.thenewinquiry.com) and [BLIP](https://www.brooklaw.edu/academics/clinicalprogram/blip/aboutblip?)
 
Overview
<p align="justify">America's for-profit bail system has created an untenable and unjust social problem wherein bail facilitates mass incarceration and social oppression.  In New York, 90% of people who can’t pay bail end up pleading guilty, and 70% of people in American jails have not yet been convicted of any crime. </p>
 
<p align="justify">Crowdsourcing bail with blockchain in New York is time-consuming and costly. The conversion process is made quite difficult as a result of NY's Bitlicense. New York has only awarded three BitLicenses to date. Crowdsourcing bail in a manner consistent with regulations changes what should be a simple matter into a byzantine process requiring multiple steps passing using only approved cryptocurrrencies passing through only approved trading partners and platforms.  The fees involved with each step reduce the amount of money available to bails.
 
 There <i>has</i> to be a better way to crowdfund and pay bail for NY detainees without sufficient resources to cover their bail.</p>
 
Teams should:
 
<ul><p align="justify">• Teams are encouraged to first consult BailBloc’s open-source code and identify any pitfalls to their current model. The code and project description are available at [Bail Bloc](https://bailbloc.thenewinquiry.com).
 
• Present a method for utilizing blockchain in the crowdsourcing of bail for indigent misdemeanor offenders that deals with the complicated New York Bitlicense scheme and the conversion process. Imagine if you could simply pay bail with Monero, BitCoin, or Ether.
</p></ul>
<p align="justify">Final team projects will be reviewed and evaluated by a panel of experienced judges, including members of the Bail Bloc team and Brooklyn Law School's [BLIP](https://www.brooklaw.edu/academics/clinicalprogram/blip/aboutblip?) team. The team submitting the most efficient, frictionless fund raising scheme will be given free subscriptions to The New Inquiry and a 2018 specialty tote bag.
